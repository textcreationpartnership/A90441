            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Vantrump lies three leagues diſtance; and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved forthwith to ingage Us; as captain Vand-Erſt informs Us, who hath deſerted them, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Parliament.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe bringeth intelligence, That the States have given Orders for the re-inforcing their Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Towns and Caſtles; and have declared to the People, That our Admiral intends to land ſome ſouldiers about the Brill, and Fluſhing, with a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to cut down the Dammes, or Sea-walls, and <pb n="5" facs="tcp:166245:3"/>ſo drown the Countrey. The allarum whereof hath ſo exaſperated the ſpirits of many, that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly inraged, and vowes revenge.</p>
               <p>We hear that there is a general Riſing from 16 to 60; and thoſe that do refuſe to to engage, are to die without mercy. They are ſetting forth another great Fleet of 200 ſail, and the Zealanders have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a new Admiral. In our laſt engagement, our loſs is eſteemed killed and wounded about 300. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies far greater.</p>
               <p>There is dayly Action between our Scouts, and Trumps; and this morning captain Peacock, with the Tyger, going to relieve the Guard, was ſet upon by three Dutch-men, who maintained a gallant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, for the ſpace of half an hour; which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral hearing of, diſpatched captain Watſon and captain Taylor to his aſſiſtance, who bearing up cloſe to them, ſaluted them with ſeveral broad ſides, inſomuch that one immediatly ſunk by their ſides; the other two got off, but much batter'd and torn, as well as ours; ſome having their legs and armes ſhot off; others lamentably ſhot and mangled. We hear that General Blake hath a deſign to block up the Zound, which will greatly fruſtrate &amp; eclipſe their liberty, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Since the receit of this Letter, further Advertiſements are come, That Admiral Vantrump having received intelligence of additional ſhips coming to us, reſolved to fight us, and fruſtrate our conjunction; in order whereunto, he advanced; but our Scouts maing a diſcovery of his approach neer the Channel, and forthwith give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice thereof to the Navy, great was the preparation made to receive them; and in purſuance thereof, ſir Geo. Ayſcue, with the Fairfax and Tryumph, bore up to them, before the head of the Fleet, and gave them 50 Guns, but was anſwer'd with the like ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute from Vantrump, and Vice-admiral Witte, who upon hanging forth their blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy flags, was the ſignal for the reſt of their Captains to fall on; inſomuch, that a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fight began, and after 700 broad ſides exchang'd, they came to grapling, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to board each other; but it prov'd a work of extreme difficulty; for no ſooner <pb n="8" facs="tcp:166245:4"/>had we aſſailed each other decks, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly the ſmall ſhot flew ſo thick from the murthering pieces, that both parties were often repelled and beaten off; and the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a long time ſeemed dubious, til at laſt ſir George &amp; Cap. Lawſon with the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow and Fairfax, bore up to the head of the Vantrump, and his vice-admiral; and after ſeveral deſperate Onſets on both ſides, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trump declined diſpute, and with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty hailed off; the viceadmiral was ſunk with two more; after which, the Redcoats of Col. Goffs Regiment, that were aboard the Speaker, being engaged with four of the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders, ſeeing no ways poſſible to free themſelves, reſolved to purchaſe their liberty, with the price of their blouds, otherwiſe to ſink by their ſides; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereunto, they plaid their Granadoes and fire-works, which did great execution, and at laſt fir'd one of their ſhips; the other three perceiving this ſad diſaſter, declined engagement; and ſoon after the whole Navy began to be in a Chaos of Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for divers of the Engliſh Frigars bearing up
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166245:5"/>cloſe to their great ſhips, gave them three ſhot for one, in which action they performed ſingular ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. However, Vantrump remains ſtill upon the Downs; and further action is ſuddenly expected. The King of Scots is deſigned for Bruſſels, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a peace between the King of France, and the K. of Spain. The K. of Poland hath ſet up his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Standard againſt the Tartars; and moſt of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are to take the field with him.</p>
               <p>Divers of the Dutch ſhips have ſet up the King of Scots Colours; and ſeem to be inclining to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; Although it is apparent, that they are both Traytors and Rebels to their Prince; and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Towns were won by the heroick At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements of Engliſt-men; and probably may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be recovered out of the hands of thoſe, who deal with England, as the Lawyer did with two men about the Oyſter, eat out the meat, and gave them the ſhell.</p>
